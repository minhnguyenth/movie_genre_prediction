1.Data-preprocessing
- drop unnecessary features to reduce model complexity: country, imdb index, year

- handle data missing

- handle categorical 

- select meaningful features ---NOT DONE

- standadize data
2. Reduce dimensionality
-PCA

3. Model evaluation and tunning hyperparameters
- use pipeline
- k-fold cross validation
- learning curve and validation curve
- grid-search for fine-tuning models

4. Test ensemble methods
- apply bagging
- apply adaboost
to compare performance

5. Sentiment analysis
- apply bag of words
- cleaning text, convert to feature vector, tf-idf

compare with word2vec



6. Save and reload pre-trained model


7. check which feature affects the models
